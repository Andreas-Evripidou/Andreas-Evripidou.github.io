            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in building innovative solutions. I graduated with First Class Honors in Computer Science from the University of Sheffield, ranking in the top 3% of my department, and I have continued to grow as a software developer since then.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I work as a Software Developer at IBM. My squad is responsible for containerizing and modernizing my team's core product; <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/app-connect">App Connect Enterprise</a>. My journey in software development began with a Year in Industry at IBM, where I contributed to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-integration">Cloud Pak for Integration</a>, further honing my skills in software engineering and cloud technologies. I have also completed a DevOps internship at <a href="https://www.xm.com/about">XM</a>, where I worked on automating the creation of multi-architecture docker images and configure an ELK stack for monitoring and analysing the teams infrastructure logs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main role consists of developing a Kubernetes Operator which allows you to configure, deploy and manage ACE integration servers declarative. I am also working on developing our CI/CD pipelines, which includes building, testing, and deploying the operator. In the near future I am also looking to contribute to my teams UI components, which are built using React and NodeJS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my main role, I enjoy participating in hackathons, patenting and working on side projects for the IBM Hursley community. I'm particularly passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices in all my projects. That why I am currently reading the Clean Code book by Robert C. Martin. Since cloud is my main area of expertise, I am also studying for cloud certifications for AWS and Microsoft's Azure cloud.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exercising, exploring the United Kingdom/Europe, and reading books. I have been a <a href="https://worldathletics.org/athletes/cyprus/andreas-evripidou-14903554">track and field athlete in the past</a>, but nowadays I mostly enjoy running, gym and calisthenics workouts.
