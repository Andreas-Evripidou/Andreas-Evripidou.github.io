          <h2>BSc Computer Science</h2>
          <p>
            BSc Computer Science is an Engineering degree where you learn how to understand the theoretical issues 
            underlying a problem and how to engineer a solution in the area of Computers.

            <h2>COM1001: Introduction to Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>The first, and most important, in my opinion, the module is the Introduction to Software Engineering.
              In com1001 we learn the process of developing a product for a client, so far we have learned how to talk to a client,
              extract information about the product and designing how the product will look like.
              Moreover, we learn how to code using the programming language Ruby and how to use the Linux command line.

            <h2>COM1002: Foundations of Computer Science</h2>
            <p>Com1002 is about Mathematics. But not the one we have learned from school.
              In Foundations of Computer Science, we are taught to develop Mathematical concepts and techniques that are important to computing. However, studying com1002 is more than learning Maths; through the lessons, you develop problem-solving skills that you can apply to the real world.

            <h2>COM1003: Java Programming</h2>
            <p>As of its name, in Java Programing we learn the basics of computer programing using Java programing language.
              We again are developing problem-solving skills through the lessons but also how to write clear, readable and re-usable code
              that we can use to create software apps that are easy to maintain and upgrade.

            <h2>Machines and Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Machines and Intelligence is a module that its theme is popular today, AI. At the start of the semester, we
              studied the history of computing, starting with Alan Turing. Now we focused on intelligent machines and agents
              that have human capabilities such as efficient completing a task, "think", understand and see.

            <h2>COM1006: Devices and Networks</h2>
            <p>
              Com1006 is my elective module. Since my initial plan was to study Electrical Engineering with Computer Science
              in a Technical University, I was very happy to have the opportunity to have Devices and Network as one of my modules.
              The lectures go through the very basic CPU architecture, logic gates, Random Acces Memory and all the necessary 
              components of a Computing machine.
